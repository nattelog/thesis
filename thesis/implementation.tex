\chapter{Implementation}

The be able to reach the goal of this thesis, to map the performance of the
abstract gateway $\Gamma$, a software system has been made. The ultimate goal
of this system is to generate and store all events and their respective
timestamps to be able to analyse the performance of $\Gamma$, which processed
them. The system consists of two processes called \textit{Frontend} and
\textit{Gateway} and an analysation tool called \textit{Report}. The main
purpose of Frontend is to simulate devices and store event data while the
purpose of Gateway is to practically act as a gateway: pull events from the
devices and process them.
