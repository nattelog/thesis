I want to give special thanks to my external supervisor Pär for your ideas,
your time and support. Thank you Anders and Attentec for accepting my original
idea, letting me conduct this thesis in your office and not to forget the
incredible trip to New York. Thank you Eric for giving me fast, continuous and
informative feedback on my work. Thank you Petru for accepting this idea as a

Last but not least: a great thank you to the love of my life, Sara. For you
