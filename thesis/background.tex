This thesis was proposed by the author and accepted by the IT consulting firm
Attentec in Linköping, Sweden. A personal interest in embedded Linux, NodeJS
and reactive architectures (as well as an interest in the company) led the
author to Attentec and a proposal of this study.

Attentec resides in Linköping and Stockholm in Sweden and in Oslo, Norway. They
focus on three major business areas: \textit{Internet of Things},
\textit{Streaming Media} and \textit{Modern Software Development}.  Their
interest in this study lies in expanding their knowledge base regarding
Internet of Things.
