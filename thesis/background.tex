\label{cha:background}

This study was conducted in the offices of the IT consulting firm Attentec in
Linköping, Sweden. With offices in three cities: Linköping, Stockholm and Oslo,
Attentec focuses on three major business areas: \textit{Internet of Things},
\textit{Streaming Media} and \textit{Modern Software Development}. Their
interest in this study lies in expanding their knowledge base regarding
Internet of Things. A personal interest in embedded Linux, NodeJS and
event-driven architectures (as well as an interest in the company) led me to
Attentec and a proposal of this study.
