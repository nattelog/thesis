**A.** What are the main results, or guidelines, of the paper that you read?
Provide a summary, and give some concrete examples of what the authors suggest
when writing a research paper.

Case studies in the software engineering field is an underdeveloped practice.
Understanding for it varies and the results do as well. The reader is presented
with a systematic and pragmatic approach to deal with case studies. The authors
presents important aspects in how to design a case study, how to prepare for
data collection, how to analyse the collected data and how to present it in a
report. For instance, three degrees of data collection techniques are presented:

1. Direct methods: the researcher is in direct contact with the subjects of the
   collection.
2. Indirect methods: the researcher collects data without interacting with the
   subjects, e.g. a survey.
3. Data is already available when collection begins. This could be documents or
   failure reports from a company.

**B.** How can you make use of the results or advice provided by the paper that
you read, in order to make an assessment of your research questions?

This paper is more focused on the methodology view of the thesis and perhaps
not the research questions.
